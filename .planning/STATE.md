# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-13)

**Core value:** For any location, the user can immediately tell how unusual today's temperature is compared to historical norms — the anomaly score must be accurate and easy to interpret at a glance.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — location-picker-shareable-shell

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (location-picker-shareable-shell) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-13 — Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 3-phase structure (coarse granularity) — Location/Shell → Current Conditions/Anomaly Engine → Historical Charts/Edge Cases, following research's dependency-ordered vertical slices
- Roadmap: PLAT-01/PLAT-02 (no login, free hosting) assigned to Phase 1 since they are foundational architecture decisions established from the first deploy onward
- [Phase ?]: hasSelection (pin visibility) tracked locally in App.tsx via hasUrlSelection(), not added to useSelectedLocation's return shape, to keep Task 2's tested hook contract stable — Task 3 files_modified list only allows MapView.tsx/App.tsx, not useSelectedLocation.ts
- [Phase ?]: readLocationFromUrl falls back per-field to its own default rather than an all-or-nothing default object — Matches RESEARCH.md Pattern 2 reference implementation extended with V5 range validation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 planning needs a deliberate decision on day-of-year window width (±3 to ±7 days cited in research, no single correct answer) and Feb 29 handling
- Phase 1 planning needs a reverse-geocoding provider decision and a tile provider decision (attribution/usage-policy safe) — both flagged as open gaps in research/SUMMARY.md
